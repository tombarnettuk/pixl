Hello all,

The admin team have been working incredibly hard in the background. After much deliberation, we are proud to announce...

🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁


PIXL

Use case
Blockchain advertisement, to collaborate with other coins to assist them in spreading awareness (advertise their coins), in exchange for further investments, mutual exposure and more.

Ever heard of the guy who created a site with one million pixels on an image and sold each pixel for one dollar? He became a millionaire instantly, and the website was extremely popular for advertising purposes.

That being said, we will aim to be the first crypto coin to do this, whilst offering other advertisement services for companies, coin holders etc to invest in our coin (thus increasing value even more).

Tokenomics
🌟 5% automatically distributed to coin holders 💰
🌟 5% distributed to LP 💰
🌟 Liquidity pool locked for 100 years 🔒
🌟 No dev wallets
🌟 Contract reliquinquished pre-release. 
🌟 Completely rug-proof! 

This will have no whales at the start, the admin / devs will have no edge, this is a fully community oriented coin and everyone has an equal chance to get in pre-sale.

We are committed to making this project last long-term ✅

We will accept any help we can from the community in promoting this coin after pre-sale. However, the idea of the pre-sale is to allow everyone affected by redmoon to get in early before the price sky-rockets.

As part of the PIXL Admin team, we have a couple who work in marketing as a profession, a few business owners and plenty more diverse professions which can attribute to the success of this coin.

This will not be a pump and dump ⛔
This will not fizzle after a week ⛔

The coin has been created, we will share the link to review the coin shortly so you can critique if necessary before pre-sale.

Please bear in mind, we have worked with solidity finance to ensure this is completely rug-proof, however, audit results will be shared once this is complete.
